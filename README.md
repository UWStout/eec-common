# Electronic Empathetic Communication Project

## End of Life
As of May 2022, this project is no longer in active development.  We may resume development in the future
but for now, it will not be maintained further and it is not in active use at Stout or in any ongoing
research projects by the original authors.

If you are interested in reviving or funding further work on this project, please contact Seth Berrier.

## Introduction
This repository contains code for the larger research into enabling more empathetic communication over
electronic mediums. It targets team chat tools (like Microsoft Teams, Discord, Slack, and Google Meet).
This should be considered a sandbox of work-in-progress for research purposes. Official releases of any
tools will be made separately from this repository.

## EEC Chrome Extension
This is a Google Chrome Extension intended to provide a general means of connecting to the EEC tool
from any page that contains a text area for sending messages. It will provide basic feedback on your
typing and attempt to connect back to the context that already exists in the EEC tool.
