# Electronic Empathetic Communication Project

## Introduction
This repository contains code for the larger research into enabling more empathetic communication over
electronic mediums. It targets team chat tools (like Microsoft Teams, Discord, Slack, and Google Meet).
This should be considered a sandbox of work-in-progress for research purposes. Official releases of any
tools will be made separately from this repository.

## EEC Chrome Extension
This is a Google Chrome Extension intended to provide a general means of connecting to the EEC tool
from any page that contains a text area for sending messages. It will provide basic feedback on your
typing and attempt to connect back to the context that already exists in the EEC tool.
